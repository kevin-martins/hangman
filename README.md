## Game

Start by a loading screen to search the word.
When the word has been choosen, the hangman will display with the missing word as dashes.
You can dispay a keyboard if you're a mobile or labtop user because there is no keyboard for them by clicking on the Arrow.

By pressing a letter that is not in the missing word, the hangman will increase and the letter will be displayed with the red color. Is the letter is in the current missing word, the letter will be green and it will appear in the missing word instead of the dash.

If you succed to guess the word, you'll win and earning some coins.
If not nothing happens you just losed.

In both case you'll be able to restart the game and going back to the Menu or Dashboard to see all the previous games you played.

## Difficulty

There are 3 difficulties level in the game from Easy passing by Challenging and to Hard. They affect the size of the word and the point gained on win.

## Dashboard
